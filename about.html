      <h1>🌐Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create a virtual notice board 📋 that will enable our users to have a perfect campus life 🏫
        by striking a balance ⚖️ between academics 📚 and extracurricular activities 🎭. <br>

        Our platform will not only unify students of the same branches 🌿 but will also bring together all students,
        regardless of their course or year of study 🎓. We aim to foster a sense of connectivity 🤝 among students from
        all branches. <br>

        Campulse will revolutionize 🔄 the interconnections between college departments 🏢, fueling collaborations 🤝,
        events 🎉, and the development of all kinds of skill sets 💻📈 that are essential in today’s professional
        world 🌎.</p>
      <p>
      <h1>🌟Vision</h1>
      <p>Our vision is to create a self-sustaining platform 🔗 that will connect not only the students of our college 🏫 but also students from all the colleges in our city 🌆. We are dedicated to building a service accessible to every student 📲, ensuring that no one misses out on valuable opportunities 🚀 to upgrade their skill set 📈 or to learn something new 📚.</p>

      <h1>📋What do we do?</h1>
      <p>Campulse is designed to provide a platfrom:

      <ul class="list">
        <li>To connect all the students of our campus.</li>
        <li>To make it 'the one place' when looking for new events and opportunities.</li>
        <li>For club managers to promote their events.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Campulse’s Events section🎉 keeps all students updated on ongoing and upcoming events 📅 from all the clubs they’re interested in. Never miss out on a chance to participate, learn, and grow! 🌟
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Notes section aims to eliminate the last-minute scramble for study materials 📚 before exams. No more begging friends and seniors for lab reports, class notes, or past exam questions – everything you need is right here! 📖✨
      </p>

      <p>
        Have you ever lost something on campus 🧢 and struggled to get it back? Or perhaps you’ve found something that belongs to someone else 👜? With Campulse’s Lost and Found section, you can upload details of lost or found items, making it easy for the owner to retrieve them! 🗂️🤝
